		Nagbabadya ang hangin na nakapalibot sa'kin<br>
Tila merong pahiwatig ako'y nananabik<br>
'Di naman napilitan kusa na lang naramdaman<br>
Ang 'di inaasahang pag-ugnay ng kalawakan<br>
Ibon sa paligid umaawit-awit<br>
Natutulala sa nakakaakit-akit mong tinatangi<br>
Napapangiti mo ang aking puso<br>
Giliw 'di mapigil ang bugso ng damdamin ko<br>
Mukhang mapapa-amin mo amin mo<br>
Giliw nagpapahiwatig na sa'yo<br>
Ang damdamin kong napagtanto na gusto kita<br>
Hindi ko alam kung saan ko sisimulan<br>
Binibigyang kulay ang larawan na para bang<br>
Ikaw ang nag-iisang bituin<br>
Nagsisilbing buwan na kapiling mo<br>
Sa likod ng mga ulap<br>
Ang tayo lamang ang tanging magaganap<br>
Ibon sa paligid umaawit-awit<br>
Natutulala sa nakakaakit-akit mong tinatangi<br>
Napapangiti mo ang aking puso<br>
Giliw 'di mapigil ang bugso ng damdamin ko<br>
Mukhang mapapa-amin mo amin mo<br>
Giliw nagpapahiwatig na sa'yo<br>
Ang damdamin kong<br>
Napagtanto na gusto kita<br>
Gusto kita<br>
Gusto kita<br>
Gusto kita<br>
Gusto kita<br>
Ano'ng salamangkang meron ka (gusto kita gusto kita)<br>
Binabalot ka ng mahika (gusto kita gusto kita)<br>
Ano'ng salamangkang meron ka (gusto kita gusto kita)<br>
Ako'y nabihag mo na<br>
Ako na nga'y nabihag mo na<br>
Hindi naman talaga sinasadya<br>
'Pagkat itinataya 'ata tayo para sa isa't isa<br>
Giliw nagpapahiwatig na sa'yo ang<br>
Da-da-da-damdamin ko<br>
Da-da-da-da-da-damdamin ko<br>
Giliw<br>
Giliw<br>
Giliw<br>
Napagtanto na<br>
Gusto kita<br></p>

	<p>Do you remember<br>
When we were young you were always with your friends<br>
Wanted to grab your hand and run away from them<br>
I knew that it was time to tell you how I feel<br>
So I made a move, I took your hand<br>
My heart was beating loud like I've never felt before<br>
You were smiling at me like you wanted more<br>
I think you're the one I've never seen before<br>
I want you to know<br>
I love you the most<br>
I'll always be there right by your side<br>
'Cause baby, you're always in my mind<br>
Just give me your forever (give me your forever)<br>
I want you to know<br>
That you'll be the one<br>
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees<br>
To say I love you<br>
And I need you<br>
And say I'd die for you (just give me your forever)<br>
I never knew<br>
It would be possible<br>
For you to be with me<br>
'Cause you loved someone else back in '73<br>
I was so jealous seeing you with him<br>
Oh baby, I know that I can treat you better back in <br>those nights<br>
Oh, you wouldn't cry from his stupid lies<br>
Oh baby, I was there watching wishing you to be mine<br>
I want you to know<br>
I love you the most<br>
I'll always be there right by your side<br>
'Cause baby, you're always in my mind<br>
Just give me your forever (give me your forever)<br>
I want you to know<br>
That you'll be the one<br>
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees<br>
To say I love you<br>
And I need you<br>
And say I'd die for you (just give me your forever)<br>
Do you remember<br>
I was on the aisle<br>
Waiting for you, babe<br>
Saw you in your gown<br>
I was crying all my tears<br>
I told myself that you are the one<br>
(You are the one)<br>
I want you to know<br>
I love you the most<br>
I'll always be there right by your side<br>
'Cause baby, you're always in my mind<br>
(You're always in mind)<br>
Just give me your forever (just give me your forever)<br>
I want you to know<br>
That you'll be the one<br>
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees<br>
To say I love you (just give me your forever)<br>
And I need you<br>
And say I'd die for you (just give me your forever)<br>
Just give me your forever<br>
Just give me your forever</p>
